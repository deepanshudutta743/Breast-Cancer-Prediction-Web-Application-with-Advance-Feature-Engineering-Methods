# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Web-Application-with-Advance-Feature-Engineering-Methods
I developed a web application  from where a user can check either she has the chances of Breast Cancer or not.Data Set from sklearn.Then I use QQ plot to find the normally distributed data.StandardScaler for Normalise data and Normalisation for normalizing the data.FunctionTransformer for mathematical transformation Ex-log, square,square root and PowerTransformer(box-cox,yeo-johnson).Z score for outlier removal. Column Transformer and Pipeline for using of multiple methods at a same time.Lastly the GridSearchCV for finding optimal paremeters for algorithms.I got 98.24% accuracy with the help of LogisticRegression.
